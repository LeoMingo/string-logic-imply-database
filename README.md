# string-logic-imply-database

This project is aimed to produce a way to translate a linguistically defined language(e.g. English) into logic propositions which are connected by imply indicators '-->'

The project is able to generate a static word set(words simply seperated by space character) and a dynamic word set(incremented words) from an input text file, we say the generated word set file as "proposition database", then hoped to make assumptions or predictions from the databases which have these two word sets, which are both mapped over by imply operators, which will vectorize the whole database in order to make an inner network among words from each kind of sets.

The generated databases are hoped to make AI boolean string reasonings more reasonable, and to make use into the machine learning. But it's just an unimplemented concept which has not yet been fully proved and developed.
